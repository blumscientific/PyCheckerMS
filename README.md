# PyCheckerMS
Checking GC-MS performance based on Testmix run (for Agilent GC-MS instruments, requires AMDIS)

Rewrite of an old Pascal based program. A Textmix is run on Agilent GC-MS(EI) equipment and the output file is run through AMDIS
resulting in a FIN file. Checker analyses performace criteria and displays results in a GUI window in a tabulated form including
some calculations on retention times, isotope ratios (not implemented in the old Checker).
